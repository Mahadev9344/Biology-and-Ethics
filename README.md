CRISPR-Cas9 has emerged as a powerful tool for precise genome editing, offering revolutionary potential in areas like gene therapy and cancer treatment. However, one major concern is its tendency to make unintended cuts in the DNA, known as off-target effects, which can lead to unwanted mutations. In this project, we propose a deep learning-based approach using a Feedforward Neural Network (FNN) to predict such off-target activity with high efficiency. We encoded guide RNA and DNA sequences into 8Ã—23 image-like matrices to feed into the model, enabling it to learn meaningful patterns. Our model was trained on a dataset of over 50,000 data points and achieved a ROC AUC of 0.82, showing strong potential for distinguishing off-targets despite class imbalance. This approach offers a simple yet effective solution for enhancing the safety of CRISPR applications and can be further expanded with balanced datasets and real-world validations in future research.
